# DroneDeck
This repository contains the source code and supporting documentation for the **DroneDeck** project, developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming in Java** course (Winter 2024). The goal is to create a Java application with a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with a drone simulation system using a [RESTful API](http://dronesim.facets-labs.com).

## Getting Started

### Tools You Need to Download

1. **IntelliJ IDEA** (Recommended IDE):  
   Download and install [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/)
   **Recommended Installation Tips**:
   - Check **Add "bin" folder to the PATH**
   - Check **Add "Open Folder as Project"**
   - Check **.java** under "Create Associations"

2. **Git** (Version Control):  
   Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

3. **GitHub Desktop** (Recommended):  
   Download [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)

4. **Postman** (Optional, for API Testing):  
   Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

5. **JDK 23** (Java Development Kit):  
   Download the latest [JDK 23](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk23-archive-downloads.html)

### Environment Setup

To successfully run the application and interact with the DroneSim API, you will need to set up an environment variable:

1. **Set the `DRONE_API_KEY` environment variable**:
   - The value of `DRONE_API_KEY` should be the API token, which you can find after logging in to [DroneSim](http://dronesim.facets-labs.com).

2. **Accessing the API from outside Frankfurt UAS**:  
   If you're working from a location other than **Frankfurt UAS**, and you want to connect to the API, you will need to download and set up [FortiClient VPN](https://www.fortinet.com/de/support/product-downloads) to connect to the Frankfurt UAS network. The API can only be accessed from within this network.
